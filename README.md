# medicationConverterCalc
Welcome to the Medication Conversion Calculator!

The Medication Conversion Calculator is a command-line calculator that converts:
mg, g, mcg, ml, l, oz, IU, and insulin units.

Typical conversions:
mg <--> g <--> mcg
ml <--> l <--> oz

Medication-specific conversions:
Insulin units <--> mL
Vitamin D IU <--> mcg

**HOW TO INSTALL**
Open the program in VSCode or your preferred code editor. Make sure you have a Python extension installed.

**HOW TO USE**
Type the number you would like to convert, the measurement you are currently using, the measurement you want as an output, and type the medication name if your conversion requires a medication. If you don't need the medication, just push enter. The program will loop back to the beginning if you have another conversion. Type 'q' to quit.
